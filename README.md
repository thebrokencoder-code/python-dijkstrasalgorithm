# python-dijkstrasalgorithm
Use non negative graph as dijkstras algorithm does not support negative weights
# Functions:

1.graph_relaxer() : To initialize the distance graph from the source evry time a source is selected 
2.decider() : To select the next node to visit according to the cost
3.pacifier() : To calculate the distance or cost and compare every time in order to assign the shortest path
4.queuemaker() : it calls every other function according to the program flow , while maintaining the algorithm flow
5.dijkstras() : Main fucntion to call the sub function ,(just to make it tidy)
6. runAlgo() : To make the program flow smooth and helps in trying new nodes without quitting the execution with some user interactions

#Note : 
- Please make corrections or improvements according to the accuracy of the algorithm ,mail me the issues so that i can improve my concept and understanding
